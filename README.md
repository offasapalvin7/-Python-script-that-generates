# -Python-script-that-generates
Certainly! Here's a Python script that generates a 10-digit random number:

To create an executable file from this script, you can use a tool like PyInstaller. Here's how you can use PyInstaller to create an executable from the script:

1 Install PyInstaller: pip install pyinstaller

Save the script to a file (e.g. generate_number.py).

Run PyInstaller to create the executable:


pyinstaller generate_number.py


This will create a standalone executable in the dist directory. You can then run the executable to generate a 10-digit random number.

Note: The executable will be platform-specific, so you'll need to create a separate executable for Windows, Linux, and macOS.
